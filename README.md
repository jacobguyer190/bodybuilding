A CHAMPION bodybuilding couple have faced court accused of stashing image-enhancing drugs and weapons in their Gold Coast home.

Officers from Taskforce Maxima allegedly found testosterone, methadone and fat-burning prescription drugs when they raided the Mermaid Waters home of Samantha Jane Heron and Josh Hourigan on December 23.

Weapons including knuckledusters and a set of handcuffs were also found in the main bedroom.

Police have alleged the couple have ties to the Finks motorcycle gang, but their lawyer Campbell MacCallum has called for police to show proof of their association.

Heron, a 25-year-old Queensland and Australasian bikini bodybuilding champion, and Hourigan, a 26-year-old personal trainer, are each charged with ten counts of possessing dangerous drugs and single counts of unlawfully possessing restricted drugs, property suspected of being proceeds of a crime, a category M weapon, and restricted items.

The couple were freed on bail before Christmas with strict conditions that they report twice a week and keep a residential condition.

Today in the Southport Magistrates Court Mr MacCallum asked their bail conditions be dropped to allow his clients to travel for work commitments.

Mr MacCallum said they had no criminal history and he was in negotiations with police to withdraw multiple charges against Heron.

"I've been given an indication the charges will be withdrawn," he said.

Police prosecutor Senior Constable Nick Wang said he had not be informed of a change in charges.

The court relaxed the couple's bail conditions and ordered them to return to court on January 20.
